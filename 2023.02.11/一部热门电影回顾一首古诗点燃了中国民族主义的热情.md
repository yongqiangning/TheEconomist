一部热门电影回顾一首古诗点燃了中国民族主义的热情

“MY HAIR bristles with anger,” young men cry as they leave their red-cushioned cinema seats. “We will feast on the barbarians’ flesh...we will drink their blood.” They are reciting lines from “Full River Red”, a poem believed to be written by Yue Fei, a 12th-century general of the Song dynasty. It is also the title of China’s top-selling film over the recent Lunar New Year holiday. The movie has grossed more than 4bn yuan ($590m) since its release on January 22nd.”

"我怒发冲冠",年轻人离开红色坐垫的电影院座位时大叫。“壮志饥餐胡虏肉，笑谈渴饮匈奴血”他们朗诵的诗句来自“满江红”，一首诗相信是由岳飞，一个12世纪的宋朝将军写的。在最近的农历新年假期，这部电影也是中国最畅销的电影。自1月22日上映以来，这部电影已经获得了超过40亿元(5.9亿美元)的票房收入。”

The film is set four years after the death of Yue, who famously led the Song kingdom’s battles against invading Jurchens, whose descendants became known as Manchus. Legend says he was killed in 1142 by Qin Hui, a corrupt Song chancellor who pushed the emperor to negotiate and stop fighting the Jurchens. In Chinese lore Qin is recalled as a hanjian, or traitor to one’s Han ethnicity, and Yue as the opposite.

这部电影的背景设定在岳逝世四年后，岳因领导宋朝对抗入侵女真人而闻名。女真人的后裔后来被称为满族。传说他在1142年被秦桧杀害，秦桧是一位腐败的宋朝大臣，他推动皇帝进行谈判并停止与女真人的战争。在中国传说中，秦被称为汉奸，或汉族的叛徒，而岳则相反。

In recent years, the Communist Party has drawn on Yue’s story to promote patriotism. State media even say that Xi Jinping, China’s leader, was raised on tales of Yue’s exploits. The movie, by one of China’s most famous directors, Zhang Yimou, has aroused vitriolic fervour. Not only have cinema-goers delivered spontaneous recitations of the chilling poem at film screenings. The movie has also prompted an increase in attacks on statues of Qin at tourist sites—a practice that has a long tradition.

近年来，共产党利用岳父的故事来宣扬爱国主义。官方媒体甚至表示，中国领导人习近平从小就听说岳父的事迹。这部由中国最著名的导演之一张艺谋执导的电影激起了尖刻的热情。观众不仅在电影放映时自发朗诵这首令人毛骨悚然的诗歌。这部电影还促使游客在旅游景点对秦雕像的攻击有所增加，这种做法有着悠久的传统。

The film is about the assassination of a Jurchen envoy in Qin’s court. There are twists and turns as characters reveal their hidden loyalties, whether to foreigners or to the Song dynasty. Qin and his lackeys are portrayed as conniving officials who lie, cheat, and kill for power—and betray the ethnic-Han people. The film’s heroes are undercover vigilantes who resent Qin’s behaviour and infiltrate his court to avenge Yue.

这部电影是关于一个女真使者在秦朝被暗杀的故事。无论是对外国人还是对宋朝，角色们都表现出了他们隐藏的忠诚，这其中充满了曲折。秦和他的走狗被描绘成一群为了权力而撒谎、欺骗和杀戮的纵容官员，他们背叛了汉族人民。影片中的主人公都是卧底义务警员，他们憎恨秦的行为，潜入他的宫廷为岳父报仇。

They try to recruit a young commander in Qin’s army, Sun Jun, who is torn between obedience to his traitorous superiors and loyalty to his people. In one scene, Sun cuts a tattoo that says “Serve the nation with utmost loyalty” off his vigilante uncle’s back as his uncle shouts that Sun is a flunkey and a “running dog” of foreigners (an oft-used insult among Chinese nationalists today). By the end, Sun turns against Qin. He leads the Han soldiers in a recitation of Yue’s poem and expression of their fervent desire to recover lost land. That scene made some viewers cry, according to reviews on Douban, a film website.

他们试图招募一位年轻的秦军指挥官，孙军，他在服从叛逆的上级和忠于他的人民之间左右为难。在一个场景中，孙从他义警叔叔的背上剪下一个写着“以最大的忠诚报效国家”的纹身，他的叔叔大喊孙是外国人的走狗和走狗(这是今天中国民族主义者经常使用的侮辱)。最后，孙与秦国反目成仇。他带领汉族士兵朗诵越国诗歌，表达他们收复失地的强烈愿望。根据电影网站豆瓣的评论，那个场景让一些观众哭了。

Full River Red” draws on ancient history, but its modern meaning is clear. The poem is a lament that national shame has not been avenged: it talks of retaking lost “mountains and rivers”. In case that is not explicit enough, one Chinese family made a video of themselves reciting the poem after watching the film, but replaced its words with modern terms. Let us “feast on American imperialists’ flesh” and “drink Han traitors’ blood,” they chant—and “unify all of China in coming years

满江红”借鉴了古代历史，但其现代意义却是清晰的。这首诗哀叹民族耻辱没有得到报复: 它谈到重新夺回失去的“山川”。如果这还不够明确的话，一个中国家庭制作了一个视频，他们在看完电影后背诵了这首诗，但是用现代术语代替了它的词语。让我们“吃美帝国主义者的肉”，“喝汉奸的血”，他们高呼ーー“在未来的岁月里统一全中国
