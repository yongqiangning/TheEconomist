Much will depend on what American officials learn from the debris and what they decide to reveal

这在很大程度上取决于美国官员从废墟中学到了什么他们决定透露什么

“THE PRECISE purpose of the Chinese balloon that drifted across America, kiboshing a brief detente in the world’s most consequential bilateral relationship, has yet to be proven. But troubling answers may soon emerge from the Atlantic. US Navy divers have already started retrieving debris from the airship, which was shot down by an American F-22 fighter jet off South Carolina on February 4th. The divers aim to complete their work within days.”

漂浮在美国各地的中国气球，在世界上最重要的双边关系中短暂缓和，其确切目的尚未得到证实。但令人不安的答案可能很快就会从大西洋浮出水面。美国海军潜水员已经开始从2月4日在南卡罗来纳州被美国 F-22战斗机击落的飞艇上收集残骸。潜水员的目标是在几天内完成工作。

The equipment they find could bolster American officials’ assertions that the balloon was part of a fleet of similar craft gathering intelligence worldwide. They say they have already got plenty of evidence from tracking it across America. Yet China is doubling down on its claim that the balloon wasmonitoring weather and blown off course. And with Chinese authorities now suggesting that they want the debris returned, the two sides seem to be heading for a stand-off that could push them deeper into a cold-war-style confrontation.

他们发现的设备可以支持美国官员的断言，即气球是一个收集全球情报的类似飞行器舰队的一部分。他们说，他们已经从全美范围内追踪到了大量的证据。然而，中国正在加倍声称气球在监测天气并偏离航线。随着中国当局现在表示希望找回残骸，双方似乎正在走向对峙，这可能会使双方更深地陷入冷战式的对峙。

in some ways, the saga echoes previous bilateral upsets, including China’s testing of an anti-satellite missile in 2007 (first revealed by American officials) and its show of muscle by trying out a prototype of a stealth fighter-jet during a visit to Beijing by a Pentagon chief in 2011. What makes it more dangerous is that both countries’ leaders are now facing intense domestic political pressure to stand up to each other. Their armed forces are already gearing up for a potential conflict over Taiwan.

在某些方面，这一传奇与之前的双边冲突有所相似，包括中国在2007年测试反卫星导弹(最初由美国官员披露) ，以及在2011年五角大楼一位负责人访问北京期间试飞隐形战斗机原型机展示实力。更加危险的是，两国领导人目前都面临着强大的国内政治压力，要求他们互相对抗。他们的武装力量已经为可能的台湾冲突做好了准备。

At first, a relatively quick resolution seemed within reach. Before the balloon was shot down, China expressed regret and said it respected the White House’s decision to postpone a visit to Beijing by Antony Blinken, America’s secretary of state, that was due to start on February 5th. That briefly held out the possibility that the two sides could manage the crisis and reschedule the visit, which was supposed to consolidate the detente since Presidents Joe Biden and Xi Jinping met in November.

起初，一个相对快速的解决方案似乎触手可及。在气球被击落之前，中国表示遗憾，并表示尊重白宫推迟美国国务卿安东尼 · 布林肯(Antony Blinken)原定于2月5日开始的北京之行的决定。这短暂地表明，双方有可能应对危机，重新安排访问日程。自去年11月拜登总统(Joe Biden)和习近平主席会晤以来，此次访问本应巩固两国关系的缓和。

But China’s rhetoric later hardened. Its foreign ministry expressed “strong dissatisfaction”, accusing America of over-reacting and violating international practice. It pledged to safeguard the interests of “relevant Chinese companies” and said it reserved the right to respond. Asked if China had demanded the return of the debris, a spokeswoman said: “The airship does not belong to the US. It belongs to China.” The defence ministry threatened to “use necessary means to deal with similar situations”.

但中国后来的措辞更为强硬。中国外交部表示“强烈不满”，指责美国反应过度，违反国际惯例。它承诺保护“相关中国企业”的利益，并表示保留回应的权利。当被问及中国是否要求归还残骸时，一位发言人表示: “这艘飞艇不属于美国。它属于中国。”国防部威胁称，将“采取必要手段应对类似情况

In America, China hawks are in full cry. Republican leaders, questioning why the balloon was not shot down earlier, originally planned a resolution criticising Mr Biden’s response but have since pivoted to a bipartisan one condemning China’s balloon escapade. “I am committed to work with China where it can advance American interests and benefit the world,” Mr Biden told Congress on February 7th. “But make no mistake: as we made clear last week, if China threatens our sovereignty, we will act to protect our country.

在美国，中国鹰派人士正在大声疾呼。共和党领导人质疑为什么气球没有在早些时候被击落，最初计划一项决议，批评拜登先生的回应，但后来转向两党一致谴责中国的气球冒险行为。“我致力于与中国合作，推进美国的利益，造福世界,”拜登先生在2月7日告诉国会。“但不要搞错了: 正如我们上周明确表示的那样，如果中国威胁到我们的主权，我们将采取行动保护我们的国家。

Some observers shrug off the episode, noting that China already has a formidable array of spy satellites. In China, there are experts with their government’s ear who suggest the Biden administration is hyping the issue to out-hawk Republicans ahead of a presidential election in 2024 and to mobilise public support for a long-term confrontation with China. “If the public does not support you, how can you engage in a new cold war?” says Jin Canrong of Renmin University in Beijing.

一些观察人士对这一插曲不以为然，他们指出，中国已经拥有一系列强大的间谍卫星。在中国，有专家认为，拜登政府正在大肆宣传这个问题，以便在2024年总统大选之前压倒共和党人，并动员公众支持与中国进行长期对抗。“如果公众不支持你，你怎么能参与一场新的冷战呢?”北京中国人民大学的金灿荣表示

But American officials insist that the balloon represents a serious threat. They say China has recently developed a fleet of them to spy, often for the People’s Liberation Army (PLA). Although less sophisticated than satellites, the balloons can gather some communication and other data only accessible at lower altitudes, and can often linger for long periods using a small solar-powered engine. They are also far cheaper.

但是美国官员坚持认为气球是一个严重的威胁。他们说中国最近发展了一支间谍舰队，通常为中国人民解放军(PLA)服务。虽然没有卫星那么复杂，但是这些气球可以收集一些只有在较低高度才能获得的通信和其他数据，并且通常可以使用小型太阳能发动机长时间逗留。它们也便宜得多。

The balloons have been spotted over countries across five continents, including Europe, and have violated the sovereignty of several, the officials say. On February 6th China acknowledged that another balloon, seen over Latin America in recent days, was one of its own but insisted that it, too, was a stray weather-monitoring airship.

这些气球已经在包括欧洲在内的五大洲的国家被发现，并且已经侵犯了几个国家的主权，官员们说。2月6日，中国承认最近几天在拉丁美洲上空看到的另一个气球是自己的气球，但坚称它也是一艘偏离轨道的气象监测飞艇。

Also that day, America’s deputy secretary of state, Wendy Sherman, led a briefing on China’s balloon espionage for about 40 embassies, according to the Washington Post. The newspaper said that American officials believe some of these operations are being run from China’s southern province of Hainan and collect military information from countries including India, Japan, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam

据《华盛顿邮报》报道，同一天，美国副国务卿温迪 · 谢尔曼为大约40个大使主持了关于中国气球间谍活动的简报会。该报说，美国官员认为，其中一些行动是在中国南部的海南省进行的，并从印度、日本、菲律宾、台湾和越南等国家收集军事情报

Some of the previous sightings were already public, including one over Japan in June 2020, another over India in January 2022 and a swarm over Taiwan last February that its armed forces linked to the PLA Rocket Force. That month, America scrambled fighters to intercept an unmanned balloon off Kauai, a Hawaiian island with a missile-testing range (the balloon was not identified as Chinese at the time).

之前的一些目击事件已经公开，包括2020年6月在日本上空的一次，2022年1月在印度上空的另一次，以及去年2月在台湾上空的一大群目击事件，当时台湾武装部队与解放军火箭部队有联系。那个月，美国紧急出动战斗机在 Kauai 附近拦截一个无人驾驶气球，这是一个夏威夷岛屿，有一个导弹试验场(那个气球当时没有被确认是中国的)。

But American officials have only revealed in recent days that Chinese government surveillance balloons have briefly transited continental America at least four times before: three during the Trump administration and once earlier in Mr Biden’s presidency. Some passed over Texas and Florida and went near sensitive military sites, the officials said.

但美国官员只是在最近几天才透露，中国政府的监控气球曾至少四次短暂飞越美国大陆: 特朗普政府时期有三次，拜登总统任期早些时候有一次。有些人经过德克萨斯州和佛罗里达州，接近敏感的军事地点，官员说

More worrying still for America, those intrusions were not detected at the time. They were identified only later by intelligence officials using “additional means of collection”, according to General Glen VanHerck, commander of the North American Aerospace Defence Command. “That’s a domain-awareness gap that we have to figure out,” he said on February 6th.

更令美国担忧的是，那些入侵行为当时并未被发现。北美防空司令部(North American Aerospace Defence Command)司令格伦•范赫克(Glen VanHerck)将军表示，情报官员后来才使用“额外的收集手段”确认了这些人的身份。“这是一个领域意识的差距，我们必须弄清楚,”他在2月6日说

This time, however, American forces spotted the Chinese balloon as it approached Alaska. That allowed them to ensure that no sensitive activities or communications were exposed nearby, and to monitor it closely and try to assess its ability to gather and transmit data. One finding that American officials say undermines China’s claims is that the balloon appears to have manoeuvred itself over military sites, including a base in Montana with intercontinental ballistic missiles.

然而，这一次，美国军队在中国气球接近阿拉斯加时发现了它。这使他们能够确保附近没有敏感活动或通信被暴露，并能够密切监测，设法评估其收集和传输数据的能力。美国官员表示，有一项发现削弱了中国的主张，那就是气球似乎已经在军事基地上空盘旋，其中包括在蒙大拿州的一个基地，该基地拥有洲际弹道导弹。

The American navy divers now hope to gather further evidence from the wreckage of the balloon, which was about 200 feet (61 metres) tall and carried kit roughly the size of a regional passenger jet. Counter-intelligence specialists have joined the search for the debris, which is spread across about three-quarters of a square mile (195 hectares) in waters less than 50 feet deep.

美国海军潜水员现在希望从气球的残骸中收集进一步的证据。这个气球大约有200英尺(61米)高，携带的装备大约相当于一架支线客机的大小。反情报专家已经加入到搜寻残骸的行列中来，这些残骸分布在不到50英尺深的水域中，面积约为0.75平方英里(195公顷)。

it is unlikely that they will find anything labelled PLA. China’s balloons are thought to carry a wide range of sensors, including some that gather meteorological data. But that data can be used to help track or guide weapons including ballistic and hypersonic missiles. And there could be incriminating kit such as electro-optical cameras or sensors that “sniff” for nuclear isotopes in the atmosphere. Some of it might even include Western dual-use technology (despite American-led efforts to stop it, China still acquires plenty).

他们不太可能找到任何标有 PLA 的东西。据认为，中国的气球携带的传感器范围很广，包括一些收集气象数据的传感器。但是这些数据可以用来帮助跟踪或制导包括弹道导弹和高超音速导弹在内的武器。此外，还可能有一些可以定罪的工具，如光电摄像机或传感器，可以“嗅探”大气中的核同位素。其中一些甚至可能包括西方的军民两用技术(尽管美国主导了阻止这种技术的努力，但中国仍然获得了大量技术)。

There may even be evidence of involvement by a Chinese civilian entity. Yet that would do little to allay American concerns. Mr Xi has in recent years ordered the civilian sector to play a greater role in national defence through what China calls a “military-civil fusion” programme. Much of China’s research on high-altitude balloons appears to have been done by the civilian Chinese Academy of Sciences. Any of that organisation’s equipment or data has to be made available to the PLA if requested.

甚至可能有证据表明中国民间实体参与其中。然而，这无助于减轻美国的担忧。近年来，习已下令民用部门通过中国所谓的“军民融合”计划，在国防领域发挥更大作用。中国对高空气球的大部分研究似乎是由民间的中国科学院完成的。如果需要，该组织的任何设备或数据都必须提供给 PLA。

What happens next will depend partly on what American officials learn from the debris and what they choose to reveal. It will also be determined by China’s response, especially if it makes good its threat of reciprocal action. As for Mr Blinken’s trip, it is unlikely to be rescheduled before the annual session of China’s parliament, which starts on March 5th. “The big issue is what is Xi Jinping telling his colleagues,” says Drew Thompson, a former Pentagon official now at the National University of Singapore. “Is he telling them, stop fussing about this and move on?

接下来会发生什么，在一定程度上将取决于美国官员从废墟中学到了什么，以及他们选择披露什么。这也将取决于中国的回应，尤其是如果中国兑现了相互行动的威胁。至于布林肯先生的行程，不太可能在3月5日开始的中国国会年度会议之前重新安排。前五角大楼官员、现供职于新加坡国立大学(National University of Singapore)的德鲁•汤普森(Drew Thompson)表示: “最大的问题是，习近平对他的同僚们说了些什么。”。“他是不是在告诉他们，别再纠结这件事了，继续生活?

America and its allies have many other questions. If Mr Xi approved the balloon’s mission, how does that tally with his recent diplomatic charm offensive? If he did not, then how come it went ahead? If it was an accident, why didn’t China promptly tell America? And if a civilian company was responsible, why not identify it and provide some details? After the balloon was downed, China refused to take a call from America’s defence secretary, Lloyd Austin. Answers will be slow to come.

美国及其盟友还有许多其它问题。如果习批准了气球的使命，这与他最近的外交魅力攻势有什么关系？如果他没有，那为什么还要继续呢？如果这是一个意外，为什么中国不及时告诉美国？如果是一家民用公司干的，为什么不确认一下并提供一些细节呢？气球被击落后，中国拒绝接听美国国防部长劳埃德•奥斯汀(Lloyd Austin)的电话。答案很快就会揭晓。
