IS IT A threat to a country’s security if opposition politicians try hard to win at the ballot box? In Hong Kong it might be deemed so. On February 6th the trial began of 47 activists and former lawmakers. Their alleged crime was to stage an unofficial primary vote ahead of elections that were due to take place in September 2020. Their aim: to pick candidates capable of winning a majority in the legislature, despite a system rigged against them.

如果反对派政治家努力在选举中获胜，会对一个国家的安全构成威胁吗？在香港，可能会被视为如此。2月6日，对47名激进分子和前议员的审判开始了。他们被指控的罪行是在定于2020年9月举行的选举之前举行非正式的初选。他们的目标是: 挑选有能力在立法机构赢得多数席位的候选人，尽管这个体制对他们不利。

This is the largest trial in Hong Kong involving a draconian national-security law that was imposed on the territory in June 2020 by the government in Beijing in order to crush dissent. The accused failed in their plot to win. The chosen candidates never made it onto the official ballot. Instead the primary’s organisers, including veterans of the territory’s protest movement such as Joshua Wong and Benny Tai, were arrested for subversion under the new legislation.

这是2020年6月北京政府为镇压异见人士而在香港实施的涉及严厉国家安全法的最大规模审判。被告没能实现他们的胜利计划。被选中的候选人从未进入正式选票。相反，初选的组织者，包括黄之锋(Joshua Wong)和戴耀廷(Benny Tai)等香港抗议运动的资深人士，却因违反新法规而被捕。

The prosecution’s case sounds like a description of how, anywhere else, opposition politicians might be expected to operate. The 47 are accused of being “well organised” and intending to “weaponise” their intended majority by voting down the government’s budget and forcing the resignation of Hong Kong’s then chief executive, Carrie Lam. Their actions had seemed legal under the territory’s existing laws, but the new legislation took effect days before the primary. For the government’s critics, it changed everything.

检方的陈述听起来像是在描述，在其它任何地方，反对派政客可能会如何运作。这47人被指“组织良好”，意图通过投票否决政府预算案，迫使时任香港特首林郑月娥辞职，来“武器化”他们原本希望获得的多数席位。根据香港现行法律，他们的行动似乎是合法的，但新法案在初选前几天生效。对于批评政府的人来说，这改变了一切。

Despite initial suggestions that it would be used sparingly, there have been 227 arrests and 135 charges under the security law, according to a database maintained by Eric Lai of King’s College London. Some of the alleged crimes are piddly, like wearing a forbidden T-shirt.

伦敦国王学院(King’s College London)的赖(Eric Lai)维护的一个数据库显示，尽管最初有人建议少用这种武器，但根据安全法，已有227人被捕，135人受到指控。一些被指控的罪行微不足道，比如穿着一件被禁止的 T 恤。

The government’s biggest concern about the 47’s plan may have been that it could have succeeded. Hong Kong’s voting system is, by design, stacked in favour of the government’s backers. But in 2020, despite official warnings that the primaries could violate the security law, 600,000 Hong Kongers turned out to vote. That showed strong support for the pro-democracy camp, perhaps even enough to secure a majority in the full elections.

政府对47人的计划最大的担忧可能是它本可以成功。按照设计，香港的投票制度有利于政府的支持者。但在2020年，尽管官方警告初选可能违反安全法，仍有60万香港人参加了投票。这表明民主派阵营得到了强有力的支持，甚至可能足以确保在全面选举中获得多数席位。

Three weeks later the government postponed the official polls, ostensibly because of covid-19. By the time the rescheduled ballot took place in December 2021 the legislature had been further restructured to give traditionally pro-government voices, such as business lobbies, even greater representation. A law had also been brought in to exclude those not judged to be “patriots”. Legislators must now swear an oath of allegiance to the central government.

三周后，政府推迟了官方投票，表面上是因为2019冠状病毒疾病。到2021年12月重新安排投票时，立法机构已经进一步改组，给予传统上亲政府的声音，例如商业游说团体更大的代表权。一项法律也被提出来，以排除那些没有被判定为“爱国者”的人。立法者现在必须向中央政府宣誓宣誓效忠君主。

The security law does not prohibit trial by jury, but allows courts to dispense with that tradition. They invariably do so, instead using a panel of national-security judges, who are picked by Hong Kong’s chief executive, John Lee, to reach verdicts. 

安全法并不禁止陪审团审判，但允许法院摒弃这一传统。他们总是这样做，而是利用由香港行政长官李(John Lee)挑选的国家安全法官小组作出裁决。

Hong Kong’s judiciary is still “basically” independent, says a barrister involved in national-security trials: the authorities do not directly instruct judges what verdict to reach. Then again, he adds, they do not need to. Under the new “regime, the government-appointed national-security judges’ tenure is reviewed annually. It seems unlikely that those who show an independent streak would have their time on the bench extended. Nor are liberal judges in lower courts likely to be promoted. 

一位参与国家安全审判的大律师表示，香港的司法机构仍然“基本上”独立: 当局并不直接指示法官做出什么判决。不过，他补充称，他们也不需要这么做。在新的“制度”下，政府任命的国家安全法官的任期每年进行一次审查。那些表现出独立个性的人似乎不太可能延长他们在位子上的时间。下级法院的自由派法官也不太可能得到晋升。

he current trial is scheduled to last for 90 days. The accused face sentences of between three years and life in prison. Thirty-one have pled guilty. Most have already spent the past two years behind bars awaiting trial. Where once defendants were assumed to have the right to bail, unless the prosecution could prove their release poses a danger, in national-security trials the burden of proof is reversed.

目前的审判计划持续90天。被告面临三年至无期徒刑的判决。31人认罪。大多数人在过去的两年里已经在监狱里等待审判。一旦被告被假定有权保释，除非检方能够证明释放他们会造成危险，在国家安全审判中，举证责任倒置。

Optimists in the pro-democracy camp wonder whether the trial, perhaps involving rousing speeches from the dock, might rekindle Hong Kongers’ passion for protest. More realistically, says one, it will simply intensify the chill that has spread across the city since the national-security law was introduced, and the belief that demanding democracy is now foolhardy. 

亲民主阵营的乐观主义者想知道，这场审判(或许包括在被告席上发表激动人心的演讲)是否会重新点燃香港人的抗议热情。其中一人表示，更现实的情况是，这只会加剧自《国家安全法》出台以来在整个城市蔓延的寒意，以及人们认为要求民主政体采取行动现在是鲁莽的想法
