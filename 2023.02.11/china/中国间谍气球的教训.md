中国间谍气球的教训

CHINA AND America are drifting towards a cold war. Distrust is turning into something far more disruptive: a contest between two irreconcilable powers, each sure that the other is bent on thwarting its rival’s core ambitions and interests. The shooting down of a Chinese balloon off South Carolina is a test of whether the two countries have the wisdom and the will to stop confrontations from spiralling out of control. The results so far are mixed.

中国和美国正逐渐走向冷战。不信任正在变成更具破坏性的东西: 两个不可调和的大国之间的竞争，每一方都确信对方一心要挫败对手的核心野心和利益。在南卡罗来纳州击落一个中国气球，是对中美两国是否有智慧和意愿阻止对抗失控的一次考验。到目前为止，结果喜忧参半。

Viewed optimistically, the downing of China’s blimp is a stroke of good fortune: an instructive but low-stakes version of a crisis that could have been much worse. In recent years, Chinese fighter jets and warships have taken scary risks as they harass planes and ships belonging to America and its allies, usually when Western armed forces show the flag or collect intelligence in international skies and seas close to China’s shores. Raising the chances of a collision still higher, Chinese commanders have been sending growing swarms of Chinese aircraft to buzz the island of Taiwan.

从乐观的角度来看，中国飞艇的坠落是一件幸运的事: 这是一场本可能更糟糕的危机的一个有益但风险较低的版本。近年来，中国战斗机和军舰冒着可怕的风险骚扰属于美国及其盟友的飞机和船只，通常是在西方武装部队在靠近中国海岸的国际空域和海域展示国旗或收集情报时。中国指挥官一直在派遣越来越多的大陆飞机飞越台湾岛，这加大了发生碰撞的可能性。

When an American missile burst the balloon, the main injury was to China’s pride. That is in happy contrast with the last known collision between the two countries’ military assets, a mid-air crash in 2001 between an American EP3 spy plane and a Chinese fighter jet that left the Chinese pilot dead and 24 American crew members in detention after an emergency landing in China.

当一枚美国导弹击破气球时，中国的自豪感受到了巨大的伤害。这与两国军事资产之间已知的最后一次碰撞形成了鲜明对比。2001年，一架美国 EP3侦察机与一架中国战斗机在空中相撞，导致中国飞行员死亡，24名美国机组人员在中国紧急降落后被拘留。

Hopeful observers may note that Chinese propaganda has not really stoked public fury about the puncturing of the Chinese airship. The main news outlets have reported the story sparingly. Semi-official media have played it for laughs, mocking America for overreacting to what China calls an errant weather balloon. At the time of writing, China had not demanded compensation and had expressed regret, at least initially. Optimists may hope that American public and political indignation will teach the Chinese army that collisions have consequences. For years, Chinese officers have shunned talks with foreign counterparts about rules for close brushes, growling that safety lies in outsiders staying away.

满怀希望的观察人士可能会注意到，中国的宣传并没有真正激起公众对中国飞艇被击穿的愤怒。主要的新闻媒体对这个故事的报道很少。半官方媒体以此为笑料，嘲笑美国对中国所谓的错误气象气球反应过度。在撰写本文时，中国尚未要求赔偿，并表示遗憾，至少在最初是这样。乐观主义者可能希望，美国公众和政界的愤怒将教会中国军队，冲突是有后果的。多年来，中国官员一直回避与外国同行就近距离接触的规则进行谈判，他们咆哮道，安全在于外国人的远离。

There is a gloomier way to view this incident, though. In 2001 Congress merely grumbled when the administration of George W. Bush expressed regret over the Chinese pilot’s death to secure the EP3 crew’s release. In today’s Washington, the partisan furies would not be so restrained. China’s self-righteous official statements this week took no account of the political pressures on President Joe Biden, as Republicans demanded he destroy the balloon forthwith. Instead, China lodged a public protest when it was eventually downed. For good measure, it accused America of “hyping up” the story, as if a free society could cover up a house-sized enemy balloon visible from the ground.

不过，我们可以用一种更悲观的方式来看待这一事件。2001年，当乔治 · W · 布什(George W. Bush)政府为确保 EP3机组人员获释而对这名中国飞行员的死亡表示遗憾时，美国国会只是表达了不满。在今天的华盛顿，党派之争不会如此克制。中国本周自以为是的官方声明没有考虑到美国总统乔•拜登(Joe Biden)面临的政治压力，因为共和党人要求他立即摧毁气球。相反，中国在最终被推翻时提出了公开抗议。另一方面，它指责美国“炒作”这个故事，好像一个自由社会可以掩盖从地面可见的一个房子大小的敌人气球

The tin-eared obnoxiousness of China’s messaging has costs. While the balloon was drifting across his country, Antony Blinken, the secretary of state, postponed a visit to Beijing planned for February 5th and 6th. It is said that Mr Biden and his advisers judged the political context too distracting for the candid discussions that Mr Blinken wanted with President Xi Jinping and other “officials. The talks were intended to test China’s apparent desire to lower bilateral tensions, and to let Mr Xi hear for himself how Mr Biden views the sharpest thorns in the relationship. These include American backing for Taiwan, the Biden administration’s efforts to limit China’s access to advanced technologies with military uses, and China’s support for Russia’s war in Ukraine.

中国信息传递的令人讨厌的声音是有代价的。当热气球飘过他的国家时，国务卿安东尼 · 布林肯推迟了原定于2月5日和6日对北京的访问。据称，拜登及其顾问认为，政治环境太过分散了布林肯希望与中国国家主席习近平及其他“官员”进行的坦诚讨论的注意力。此次会谈旨在测试中国降低双边紧张关系的明显愿望，并让习亲耳听到拜登如何看待中美关系中最棘手的问题。其中包括美国对台湾的支持，拜登政府限制中国获取具有军事用途的先进技术的努力，以及中国对俄罗斯在乌克兰的战争的支持。

This was not intended as a “boy-scout” visit to suggest policy areas where the two sides could “play nicely”, says Daniel Russel, a former assistant secretary of state and Asia adviser to Barack Obama’s administration who is now at the Asia Society Policy Institute. Instead the aim was to spell out Chinese behaviours liable to ratchet up tensions, and to suggest actions that could lower them. Mr Russel sees the two countries in “uncharted” territory as they feel their way towards a new equilibrium, balancing often-incompatible goals and worldviews with deep economic integration. Mr Blinken’s trip was supposed to be a “no-kidding effort to walk Xi through US policy, rather than leave him with whatever skewed interpretation he may get from his own services”, says Mr Russel. He hopes that the visit can be rearranged soon.

美国前助理国务卿、巴拉克•奥巴马(Barack Obama)政府亚洲事务顾问、现供职于亚洲协会政策研究所(Asia Society Policy Institute)的丹尼尔•拉塞尔(Daniel Russel)表示: “此次访问的目的不是像‘童子军’那样，提出双方可以“好好合作”的政策领域。”。相反，他们的目的是阐明中国可能加剧紧张局势的行为，并提出可以降低紧张局势的行动建议。拉塞尔先生认为这两个国家处于“未知的”领域，他们正在摸索通往一种新的平衡的道路，在经常不相容的目标和世界观与深度经济一体化之间找到平衡。拉塞尔表示，布林肯此行本应是“一次不开玩笑的努力，目的是让习了解美国的政策，而不是让他从自己的服务中得到任何扭曲的解读”。他希望能尽快重新安排这次访问。

Some Chinese scholars also hope the talks will be rescheduled. Da Wei, director of Tsinghua University’s Centre for International Security and Strategy, insists that China wants to stabilise relations with America. Beyond avoiding conflicts, China seeks normal trade ties and exchanges of people, says the professor. He challenges Western analysts who think China is waging a charm offensive because it regrets its previous hardline policies. Instead, in his telling, China was waiting for the Biden administration to be ready to engage, once America felt stronger domestically and surer of its allies. Mr Da sees this year as a window of opportunity for talks, before American elections in 2024. He pins cautious hopes on “reasonable” officials, business bosses and academics on each side who still seek co-operation. But he has seen few signs of the two countries managing the balloon crisis effectively. “Both in China and the US, there are still some people working for stable bilateral relations, but they are in a minority,” he worries.

一些中国学者也希望重新安排会谈时间。清华大学国际安全与战略中心主任大伟坚称，中国希望稳定与美国的关系。这位教授表示，除了避免冲突，中国还寻求建立正常的贸易关系和人员交流。他挑战了西方分析家的观点，这些分析家认为中国正在发动魅力攻势，因为它对以前的强硬政策感到遗憾。相反，在他的讲话中，中国正在等待拜登政府做好准备，一旦美国国内感到更强大，对盟友更有信心，中国就会介入。达先生把今年看作是在2024年美国大选之前进行谈判的一个机会窗口。他把谨慎的希望寄托在双方仍在寻求合作的“理性”官员、企业老板和学者身上。但他几乎没有看到两国有效应对气球危机的迹象。“无论是在中国还是在美国，仍然有一些人致力于稳定的双边关系，但他们只是少数,”他担心

A new cold war would differ from the first one. America and the Soviet Union did little business with each other. By contrast, two-way trade between China and America runs at about $2bn a day. Against that, commerce is not the path to mutual understanding that it was. For one thing, American politicians are growing warier of Chinese investments in sectors from high technology to farmland. In 2020 Chinese-owned firms employed just 120,000 workers in America, a sharp decline. Communist Party bosses call American suspicions “anti-China hysteria”. If Mr Xi wants to avoid dangerous collisions, he should answer Mr Biden’s calls for a relationship with guardrails. ■

新的冷战将与第一次不同。美国和苏联之间几乎没有贸易往来。相比之下，中美双边贸易额约为每天20亿美元。与此相反，商业并不是通往相互理解的道路。首先，美国政界人士对中国在从高科技到农业等领域的投资越来越谨慎。2020年，中资企业在美国只雇佣了120,000名工人，急剧下降。共产党高层把美国的怀疑称为“反华歇斯底里”。如果习希望避免危险的碰撞，他应该响应拜登提出的与护栏建立关系的呼吁。￭
